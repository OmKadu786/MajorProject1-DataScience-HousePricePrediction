# MajorProject1-DataScience-HousePricePrediction

📘 Overview

This project builds and evaluates regression models to predict house prices in India, specifically using the Bengaluru House Price dataset.
The model uses features such as area (total_sqft), number of bathrooms (bath), number of bedrooms (bhk), and location to estimate the property price.

🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning regression model that can accurately predict house prices based on various property attributes.
This helps potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in estimating property values and making data-driven decisions.
