# MajorProject1-DataScience-HousePricePrediction
This project builds and evaluates regression models to predict house prices in India, specifically using the Bengaluru House Price dataset. The model uses features such as area (total_sqft), number of bathrooms (bath), number of bedrooms (bhk), and location to estimate the property price.
